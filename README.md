Machine Learning Algorithms from SCRATCH:

    --KNN
    
    --KMeans
    
    -Naive Bayes
    
    -Linear Regression (OLS and Gradient Descent)

MNIST and Eigenfaces

    -Eigenfaces comes with an explanationt o the Linear Algebra behind the Sklearn Models, as well as as an explanation into Eigenfaces.
    
    -(Should add predictions and modeling based off both).
